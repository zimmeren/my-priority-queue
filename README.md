# my-priority-queue
iOS and Android app for making deliverables more transparent

The end goal of this app is to be a portal for dependent parties to track when their items will be delivered in real time.
This app will act as a portal for them to see where in your queue their item is and a way for the owner to be
transparent about the status and what obligations they have to other tasks. 
The user will rank their open work in order of priority and add and remove tasks as appropriate. 
Other users will be able to search usernames and see their list

Current Minimum Viable Product will include the following features:
- Account Creation
- A Personal list that supports ordering, adding, and deleting
- A portal that can view the queues of other users 

Future TODOs:
- Data task aggregation from project management solultions like slack
- Group Viewing permissions to allow queues to only be shared to selected users
- General UI improvements


# iOS

A functioning app that implements all the minimum viable product features.
Until server is complete it is using a local mocked out dataset that implements the same protocols the
server will use. 

# Android

In Progress
